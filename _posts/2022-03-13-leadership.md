I never planned to lead.

Entering into technology I was mostly excited to learn, to be a contributor and to code. If I'm honest, beyond the users I probably didn't consider the people aspect of my career at all. Years on I have realised there have been people aspects and responsibilities throughout my career in this industry. It's strengthened me as an engineer and helped me grow as a person.

In this post I will walk through the different forms of leadership. I'll also outline some of the methodologies and behaviours I've found useful while developing other people.

## Developing others through engineering practices

As engineers, if we work following certain practices, we are encouraged to knowledge share; to help each other develop and grow in our skill set. This is a form of technical leadership. 

### Pull Requests

One such practice is using pull requests to both give and receive feedback on our work. Given different peoples styles, these comments can lead to discussion or sharing of resources. 

Some of the leadership skill sets you practice through pull requests include:

**Giving constructive feedback**

It is expected, when giving feedbacks on others work, that we are professional and respectful. One of the skill sets that can be developed through pull requests is giving feedback which is actionable, while remaining open to alternative points of view or implementation. Some of the pull requests that I've learnt the most from have been supported with links that I could read myself or have lead to discussions on the pros and cons of different routes.

As pull request comments are in text format, a lot of the subtleties that we rely on such as tone or body language are lost. Through practice we learn how to come across in a respectful and helpful way while writing. This is a skill set that will be useful throughout your entire career.

**Adapting to others communication or learning styles**

It is very common for people to have different ways in which they take in information. Some of us absorb information through learning, others prefer visuals or doing something active, and often a combination of all. You may find that from your pull request comments people will ask for your assistance to learn more, either through resources, a chat or a pairing opportunity.

**Sharing resources**


**Listening and receiving feedback**


### Pairing

Another practice some engineers partake in which also helps us develop and grow in the methods we will later use to communicate as leaders is pairing. 

## Mentoring, Coaching and Sponsorship


## Leading technical decisions


## People management
