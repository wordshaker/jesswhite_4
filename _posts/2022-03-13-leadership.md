I never planned to lead.

Entering into technology I was mostly excited to learn, to be a contributor and to code. If I'm honest, beyond the users I probably didn't consider the people aspect of my career at all. Years on I have realised there have been people aspects and responsibilities throughout my career in this industry. It's strengthened me as an engineer and helped me grow as a person.

In this post I will walk through the different forms of leadership. I'll also outline some of the methodologies and behaviours I've found useful while developing other people.

## Developing others through engineering practices

As engineers, if we work following certain practices, we are encouraged to knowledge share; to help each other develop and grow in our skill set. This is a form of technical leadership. 

One such practice is using pull requests to both give and receive feedback on our work. Given different peoples styles, these comments can lead to discussion or sharing of resources. Another is pairing, working with others to find an appropriate solution to the problems being solved while keeping quality in mind.

Some of the leadership skill sets you practice through pull requests and pairing include:

**Giving constructive feedback**

It is expected, when giving feedbacks on others work, that we are professional and respectful. One of the skill sets that can be developed through pull requests is giving feedback which is actionable, while remaining open to alternative points of view or implementation. Some of the pull requests that I've learnt the most from have been supported with links that I could read myself or have lead to discussions on the pros and cons of different routes.

As pull request comments are in text format, a lot of the subtleties that we rely on such as tone or body language are lost. Through practice we learn how to come across in a respectful and helpful way while writing. This is a skill set that will be useful throughout your entire career.

When pairing, giving feedback may be considered easier, as whether in person or remotely, you are typically able to convey through tone what you can't through text. However, there is a skill to be learnt in not letting your emotions come through too strongly in the way you give feedback. When you are frustrated at the problem, try not to take it out on the person you are working with. Be mindful of not being too quick or too harsh with criticism as it may not always come out in a constructive way and could be detrimental. These are all important for when you grow into leadership positions.

**Adapting to others communication or learning styles**

It is very common for people to have different ways in which they take in information. Some of us absorb information through learning, others prefer visuals or doing something active, and often a combination of all. You may find that from your pull request comments people will ask for your assistance to learn more, either through resources, a chat or a pairing opportunity. When pairing, you may find you need to take time away from the screen to talk through or depict different approaches that can be taken. If the pairing is being used as a training opportunity, it's often encouraged to move away from the code to vary the different ways in which the more juniour member may think the problem through.

**Listening and receiving feedback**

As well as being able to give feedback, those who lead and develop others need to build the skill sets of being able to receive feedback and act on it. By taking part in pull requests, each person practices taking feedback on their approaches and learn to take on board other peoples opinions and approaches. While pairing you learn to listen to your partner. It may be that you are pairing with someone you are training, and in that case you learn to give them room to explore and sometimes fail, to help with their learning and growth. How these interactions are approached depends very much on the dynamic of the people taking part in the work.

Typically these behaviours wouldn't be considered "leadership" per-se, but in my view they are all practices which aide us in developing others, professionally and personally. The following section explores what may be more typically be thought of as peoples first foray into leadership: mentoring, coaching and sponsorship. Though these concepts overlap, I personally see them as three different disciplines, with slightly differing requirements and skill sets.

## Mentoring, Coaching and Sponsorship

When being a Mentor, Coach or Sponsor, you may be asked to take up this role in a personal or a technical capacity, or a combination of both. There are a lot of valuable resources and training material out there to help you when you take up this responsibility, but note, you can do theses roles whenever you feel comfortable to. There is no minimum requirement or expectation to make you a capable and effective mentor, coach or sponsor.

### Mentoring
For mentoring there tends to be a dynamic between the mentor and mentee, where the mentor had more experience in an area a mentee wants to explore. They are to some degree more senior in an area or topic and the mentee wishes to learn from them.

Mentoring often requires quite a high degree of structure. Whether it's guiding the mentee with suggestions, developing a plan for the mentee to follow; there will be an element of goal setting to give that person a path to follow. There are a number of useful patterns you can follow as a mentor which I will discuss in a later blog post. 

Because a mentor is expected to give guidance to a mentee about their options and pathways, there is a strong level of trust in this dynamic. Trust that the mentor is making their best efforts to give advice that is suitable for the person they are responsible for. Trust that the mentee will make efforts to take on advice, try to meet their goals, and be open and honest if the route isn't quite right for them or the structure of the relationship isn't suiting them or their learning style as well
