After having a brilliant time volunteering at NDC London earlier this year ([blog post here](http://jesswhite.co.uk/2017-01-29/ndclondon-post/)) I snatched the chance to volunteer at Oslo. Moreton and I booked our flights and hotel, packed our bags and headed to Norway.

We woke at 3am and after travelling on many trains, planes and automobiles, finally arrived in Oslo, the birth place of NDC. After a quick snack it was time to find out more about what being a volunteer would involve.

After a tour of the venue (which was GIGANTIC compared to London), we were put to work: unpacking lanyards and hoodies ready for the following day. There were a few familiar faces that were good to catch up with and we met a few people we would become friends with over the following days. After working up a sweat, and collecting our badges, we all went home for some well earned sleep . 

##### First Day

7.45am all the volunteers gathered for the very first day of the conference. Moreton and I were on badge duty - he scanned tickets & I passed out the printed badge labels. It was great fun seeing a mixture of excited and jet lagged faces entering the conference. Though we had some technical difficulties, we were done with plenty of time to see the Keynote by [Dylan Beattie](https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie).

Walking in to [I Want My NDC ](https://twitter.com/dylanbeattie/status/868846378151284736), feeling the buzz from the attendees, it was hard not to get excited. Dylan is a fantastic speaker if you want to both laugh and cogitate. He was a fantastic choice for Keynote and did not disappoint. 

I was working Room 1 the morning of the first day. The first talk was [Building a Serverless, EventSourced Slack clone by Andy Davies](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/building-a-serverless-eventsourced-slack-clone/) and the second [Serilog: Instrumentation that Works for You by Nicholas Blumhardt](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/serilog-instrumentation-that-works-for-you/).

I'm a big fan of Serilog and of Nicholas' blog. At work I've been working on a centralised logging project using Serilog and Elastic Stack. As such I was thrilled to see him speak, and was not let down. It was very lucky that I got assigned that room as my first one of NDC.

The afternoon I was off duty and chose to watch the following:

* [Data magic with the Elastic stack! by Aleksander Stensby](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/data-magic-with-the-elastic-stack/)

* [Building Resilient Applications In Microsoft Azure by Scott Allen](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/building-resilient-applications-in-microsoft-azure/)

* [Getting real(time) with Akka.NET, React and Redux by Francis Paulin](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/getting-realtime-with-akka-net-react-and-redux/)

* [Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of APIness : The Secret to Happy Code by Dylan Beattie](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/life-liberty-and-the-pursuit-of-apiness-the-secret-to-happy-code/)

After Nicholas', Aleksander's and Dylan's talks I was buzzing about monitoring & the power of Elastic. I was ready to get back into the swing of my work and it re-lit the fire of this particular passion. It has been a fantastic first day, and what's a better way to top it of than with a boat cruise.

##### Boat Cruise

In the beautiful sunshine, ~200 NDC attendees boarded on two boats to enjoy a shrimp feast, each others company and the view.

If you go to NDC, do the cruise. We had an amazing time. I laughed so much my sides ached (I'm blaming Todd for a lot of that). 

##### Second Day

For the second day, I had the afternoon shift. After a little lie in to get over the lack of sleep from travelling. First of all we went to see [Scaling Docker Containers using Kubernetes and Azure Container Service by Ben Hall](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/scaling-docker-containers-using-kubernetes-and-azure-container-service/). I use Docker at work, and Moreton wanted to learn more. Ben Hall is an excellent speaker when you want to learn about Docker.

After this we went to watch ["Doing Devops" as a politically powerless developer by Damian Brady](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/doing-devops-as-a-politically-powerless-developer/). This is enlightening if you want to know how to more about convincing your company / helping your team to work in a devops way.

In the afternoon, I was the volunteer for Room 1. One of the great things about volunteering is that you see talks you wouldn't have necessarily seen. In the case of that particular afternoon I saw [Keeping the Noisy Neighbors Happy by Eran Stiler](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/keeping-the-noisy-neighbors-happy/) which is a talk on multi-tenancy - a subject I knew nothing about. This was followed by [It's NDC - But Not As We Know It](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/tba-8/) - an entertaining and educational panel discussion for the masses. Finally I saw [The Web lands in the Virtual and Mixed Realities by Maximiliano Firtman](http://ndcoslo.com/talk/the-web-lands-in-the-virtual-and-mixed-realities/) which was a great overview of current VR technologies. This is again another area I know little about.
