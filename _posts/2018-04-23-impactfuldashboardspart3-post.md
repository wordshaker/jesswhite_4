### Danger Signs

We have covered what needs to be covered on a day-to-day aspect of working with dashboardsThere are a number of signs that a dashboard may need a bit of clearing up or re-work. Here we will go through a few of them, why they might happen and what to do when they do.

```
Out of date metrics
Lack of purpose
Unclear metrics
Not knowing how to react to measurements
Busy boards
Making dashboards as part of a tick box exercise
Too many boards
Not knowing the baseline behaviour
Single point of responsibility
Pie Charts
Vanity Metrics.
```
