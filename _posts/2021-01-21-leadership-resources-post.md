## Books

### [Drive - Daniel Pink](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0033TI4BW/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

The full title of this book is _Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us_. I found it an enjoyable read which explored motivational theory in a way that rang true. The book goes through a number of examples of this motivational theory in practice, and in all honesty though I think this is a great book, the video linked later gives you the content you need to take away from this book. 

The importance of **AUTONOMY**, **MASTERY** and **PURPOSE** is something I revisit often mentally in both my professional and personal life.


### [Radical Candor - Kim Scott](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01LW1LESC/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

The full title of this book is _Radical Candor: How to Get What You Want by Saying What You Mean_. Kim leans on her experience and talks through applied examples of not only how to use "radical candor" but also why. They explore damaging behaviours as well as how to correct them to give constructive criticism and communicate effectively.

I didn't find this book dry, or hard to read. I devoured it in a couple of days. Some others I've spoken to weren't fond of the many examples from Kims past, but each to their own.

### [Managing Humans - Michael Lopp](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1484221575/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)

## Videos

### [5 Minute Summary - Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1SDV8nxypE)

This video is an excellent summary of the book Drive by Daniel Pink. It gives you all the take home points from a really great book in a concise and engaging format.

### [Productivity Game YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC02x9yG9ZFF_VZp1VnMoptg)

This YouTube channel has 5 - 10 minute summaries of many of the books I've been "meaning to read" for years. These books have been recommended to me time and time again and I've failed and buying them or prioritize reading them.

Each of the videos is accompanied with PDFs with more detailed summaries of the books covered in case the viewer wants further depth without reading the whole book.

There are playlists to help focus on the area you want to learn more about including Personal Development and Peak Performance, Business and Innovation and Influence and Leadership.

## Websites

### [LeadDev](https://theleaddeveloper.com/)

LeadDev provides resources in a number formats for new and experienced managers. They run conferences and workshops, host all of their past talks online, have a number of blogs on the topic and more. 

I've watched a few of their videos and attended their conferences. I highly rate their content.
