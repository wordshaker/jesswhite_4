<h3> Nottingham's excellent tech scene and offerings. </h3>

Nottingham is a great place to be in tech, and not only because of the brilliant businesses and projects ([see the Tech Nation report from last year](https://technation.techcityuk.com/cluster/nottingham/)). It has a fantastic community and culture, as well as events and experiences to enjoy.

Here is a list of a few things that make Nottingham a great tech city in my opinion.

### Meetups

There are currently over 30 tech meetups arranged in Nottingham. A list of the event and times can be found at [Nottingham.Digital](https://nottingham.digital/).

### Hackathons
 
There are a few hackathons around the midlands - including [Hack Manchester]() and [Hack The Midlands](). Nottingham now hosts a number of different hackathons, each with their own uniqueness.

- **[Notts GovJam](http://www.govjam.org/content/about)** is happening on the 6th - 7th of June. The challenges of this hack is to find innovative solutions to problems faced by the public sector. As far as I'm aware, this is the first GovJam to be hosted in Nottingham. There are some fantastic people involved so it's sure to be a fantastic event.

- **[HackNotts](http://hacknotts.com/)** is a hackathon for high school, undergraduate or postgraduate students, or graduates who are less than a year out of university. Hackathons are a great place and environment to learn. If you aren't eligible to take part in the hack - that's okay! Be a volunteer! You can soak up the fun of the event, help keep it running smoothly and meet some fantastic people making great projects.

- **[Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/)** has already happened this year, in January. The focus of this event is for teams to make games with advice for some lead game developers. A theme is given out at the beginning of the event and sponsors make various tools available throughout the 48 hours. It's not a competition, just a chance to have fun making something cool.

- **[Hack24](https://www.hack24.co.uk/)** has also already happened this year. I've written about it previously in my blog post [Hack24 '17, The Greatest Place On Earth](http://jesswhite.co.uk/hack242017-post/), and as you can probably tell from that title alone it is very close to my heart. Sponsors set challenges for teams to take part in and compete to win challenges. The focus of the event isn't the competition though. There is fantastic food, games, and general merriment. 

I could write an entire post on all the great things about hackathons and the benefits of them. One day I might, but you should definitely try to experience one for yourself. You don't need to be a developer! Just arrive wanting to have fun!
