> An overview on the different forms of dashboards, what they are useful for and for whom.

There are a lot of common questions around dashboards including how long they should live and what should be on them. This questions aren't going to be addressed in this post. Instead, we are taking a step back to examine what types of dashboards there are, what they are for, and who needs them.

Dashboards are beautiful and powerful tools. They come in many forms, each with their own strengths, purpose and evolution. There is a bit of overlap on these categories and how they are used, which will be covered.

The information in this post uses a cumulation of my own experience (I have been involved in the development of developer, MI and BI dashboards), talking to those with more experience than myself and extensive reading.

### MI and BI Dashboards

These dashboards are primarily for business use. The data on them are relatively high level. BI (aka Business Intelligence) dashboards show data that can be used to inform business strategy. These may include any major events that have had an effect on the business to help  

MI (Management Information) contains information that can be used to measure the health of the business financially. This can include monitoring of sales, losses or attendance.

Both of these types have their own uses and are equally brilliant. They can also be combined to be of interest to a wider audience and have added uses! Not unlike a very cool transformer.
