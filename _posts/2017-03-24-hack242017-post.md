### My Tech Life and Tech Notts.

[Tech Nottingham](http://www.technottingham.com/), [Hack24](http://www.hack24.co.uk) and the people involved are incredibly close to my heart. Moreton took me to Tech Nottingham before I even
 started my Computer Science course. Soon after that I was attending the first Hack24. It's strange to think my life in tech has been pretty
 much documented by Hack24 photos.

Even what is now a massive part of my life, [Women In Tech Nottingham](www.womenintechnotts.co.uk), would not have happened if it weren't for the Sewards. [Andrew](https://twitter.com/MrAndrew) is the 
one who talked me into creating a safe space to encourage more people into the social part of our fine tech community.

Talking of, just under a year ago I did an interview with [Jonathan](https://twitter.com/jbjon) on [Twine Radio](http://twineradio.co.uk/) talking about the plans I had for it at the 
time. I stated that I wanted the group to have a presence at Hack24 in 2017. At the time I had no idea that this could be a real possibility, it was a pipe dream.
 I think that brings us nicely to this years hack...

### Hack24 2017

So we fast forward to last weekend. Hack24 kindly donated 8 tickets to WITNOTTS for this year. Enough for two whole teams.

*Team Wild Garlic, Basil, Olive Oil, Pine Nuts & a Pinch of Salt & Pepper:* Amy Dickens, Maria Digregorio, Bety Mehide & Alexa Spors

*Team Totally Triumphant Bodacious Babes:* Helen Clark, Elsa, Jessica White & Laura Rossi

Before the event I was extremely nervous. Worked myself into a complete panic. This happens EVERY SINGLE YEAR. Within the first hour of
being at Hack24 all this anxiety disappers.

Both teams came to the event with the aim of having fun. It's safe to say we achieved that! The ladies were fully supportive of each other 
constantly making sure that the others were doing okay and having a laugh. Even if many of Elsa's laughs were directed at the face I make when
I'm concentrating. (Don't worry Elsa - I still think you are awesome!)

The WITNOTTS Code of Conduct is based off the classic Bill and Ted quote _"Be Excellent To Each Other"_. I could not be prouder of our members and 
how much they live and breathe this ethic. We helped each other. We helped others. We had a good time and made sure everyone around us was having 
a good time too. The rest of Nottingham must have a similar ethic as our stickers disappered quickly.

A lot happened while we were coding. If I were to cover it all this would become a novel. In summary - the hot chocolate was addictive, the company couldn't 
have been better and the volunteers are world class. 

Finally the air horn sounded and it was time to make our videos. Ths bit is always fun. For ours we acted out how people would use our app, which meant 
running around Nottingham doing bonkers things and tweeting about it. If it hasn't been removed yet you can view Team Totally Triumphant Bodacious Babes entry here:

### The Results 

All in all not only did the WITNOTTS teams do well, but some teams containing our members did as well! 

- Team Wild Garlic, Basil, Olive Oil, Pine Nuts & a Pinch of Salt & Pepper won two challenges: Esendex and Packed Pixels.
- Team Totally Triumphant Bodacious Babes came second in the Cronofy challenge
- WITNOTTS members Samathy and Alex's team won the Unidays challenge

I'm not going to lie - I was ECSTATIC that we won something. I couldn't stop giggling for a long time afterwards purely due to the shock.

The best result in my opinion though is that we had ladies in our teams that hadn't been to many tech events and for which this was their first Hack.
Not only are they planning to go to Hack24 2018, but have also been asking about other events in Nottingham and have been inspired to complete tech 
related projects. Getting people inspired by tech and to join in with the greater tech community is what makes all this worthwhile. Bringing more people into it, 
strenghtening it & making it thrive. 

Thank you [Tech Nottingham](http://www.technottingham.com/) for building a welcoming tech family.
