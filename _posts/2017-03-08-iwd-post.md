In case you missed the tweets, the posts, the events, the t-shirts... It's [International Women's Day](https://www.internationalwomensday.com/) today.  (Not only is this day to celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievement of women, but also to support women's advancement towards parity.

This year has had many highs and lows in terms of women in technology from less than 12 months ago, [Admiral Grace Hopper and Margaret Hamilton receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom](http://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/g8356137/2016-presidential-medal-of-freedom/) to the explosive article about [Susan J. Fowlers experience at Uber](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber). Here I don't want to explore the grander scale of women in technology or even wider than that. Instead, I'm going to keep it short, sweet and closer to home.

Next month is the first birthday of [Women In Tech Nottingham](https://www.meetup.com/Women-In-Tech-Nottingham/)! 12 months of meeting great people, seeing great presentations and having the honor of being more involved in Nottingham's great tech community.

To celebrate International Women's Day 2017 we hosted a showing of [Hidden Figures](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4846340/). This was in collaboration with HackManchester, Manchester Girl Geeks, Ladies of Code Manchester, SheSays Manchester, Ladies that UX Manchester, Liverpool Girl Geeks and Tech Events North West led by the empowering Gemma Cameron.

Now, honestly, last week was tiring! We had a WiT meetup event on the Thursday evening and the cinema screening on the Sunday. That morning, the rain was coming down, I was exhausted... I had no idea what was in store.

We had a fantastic range of attendees for the event. Thanks to our sponsors [Tech North](http://technorthhq.com/), [Tech Nottingham](http://www.technottingham.com/) and [Esendex](https://www.esendex.co.uk/careers); popcorn, sweets and tickets were provided. Thank you sponsors!

After a short introduction, Katharine Childs talked to us about Code Club East Midlands. [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) are a fantastic organisation which WiT will support as much as we can. With the help of volunteers Code Club teaches children to code. This club is enabling kids to learn really early on that engineering is a lot of fun. Code club are always recruiting so if you would like to find out more, click the link. Click it now!

It takes £75 to put a child through Code Club for one year. From the #IWD2017 Hidden Figures donations we were £10 short of funding two children for a year. The [JustGiving page will be kept open to the end of the week](https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/IWD-WITNOTTS), so if you want to help...

After the introductions, it was time for the film. If you haven't seen it you should. You will laugh , cry, feel empowered, and want to wear pearls. It's truly inspirational.

Sunday was a reminder of the great community we have in Nottingham. I started off talking about the meetup is because this event was yet another reminder of how privileged we are to be surrounded by strong, intelligent women & supporters of women who are kind enough to share their knowledge and experience.

In 12 months this small meetup has grown to become a community. From our youngest member at 7 to the fully grown. Women and supporters of women. This International Womens Day I want to take the chance to say thank you to all the people I have met on this grand adventure. I look forward to more great events & hopefully to more chances to support organisations encouraging diverse groups into engineering fields. It's a great place to be.
