## Outreach
- **Supporting Second Year Projects for The University of Nottingham** _(2018 - 2020)_

I project managed second-year projects for The University Of Nottingham. This involved coming up with the projects, coordinating with the university, organising workshops, managing the mentors of the project, making sure the work was on track and that both the company and students were getting the most out of the experience. 

_Unidays 2018, Experian UK (2019 and 2020)_

- **Q&A Sessions & advocacy for School Of Code** _(2019 - present)_

<a href="https://blog.schoolofcode.co.uk" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">School Of Code</a> has been running since 2019 and for all cohorts of students I have ran an "untweetable truth" Q&A session. I am a huge supporter of this initiative and am very vocal about it on all social media.

-  **Careers Fairs at Local Secondary Schools** _(2017 - 2018)_

I have ran stalls at a couple of careers fairs promoting the local tech community and jobs to secondary school students.

Co-presented between talks with <a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanfmills" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Jonathan Mills</a> for 3 hours of Dev Around The Sun. this was a conference-come-telethon to raise money for Direct Reliefs Corona Virus Fund.

### Organisations
- **<a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2020/06/15/net-foundation-election-2020-nominations-open" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">.NET Nomination Committee</a>** _(2020)_

This was alongside Julie Lerman, Steve (Ardalis) Smith, Iris Classon and Rabeb Othman. This committee was put together to encourage people to submit to the .NET Foundation board elections, with some focus on increasing all forms of diversity. As a group it was also our responsibility to narrow down the submissions down to 18 which the community could vote on. This gives a choice of around 3 people per board seat.
