## Outreach

#### 2018 - Present
- **Supporting Second Year Projects for The University of Nottingham**
At UNiDAYS in 2018 I project managed two second-year projects for The University Of Nottingham. This involved coming up with the projects, coordinating with the university, organising workshops, managing the mentors of the project, making sure the work was on track and that both the company and students were getting the most out of the experience. 

    I am now (2019) assisting on running the same initiative with my employer, Experian.

- **Q&A Sessions & advocacy for School Of Code**
<a href="https://blog.schoolofcode.co.uk" target="_blank">School Of Code</a> has been running for two years now (2019) and for both cohorts of students I have ran an "untweetable truth" Q&A session. I am a huge supporter of this initiative and am very vocal about it on all social media.

#### 2017 - 2018

-  **Careers Fairs at Local Secondary Schools**
I have ran stalls at a couple of careers fairs promoting the local tech community and jobs to secondary school students.
