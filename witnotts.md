#### Women In Tech Nottingham

Women In Tech Nottingham (WiT) is a monthly meetup for women from all area’s of technology (developers, testers, product owners, project managers, CTOs etc.) and those with an emerging interest in technology. 

WiT aims to provide attendees with a space where they can network, mingle, share ideas and learn in a comfortable setting. We want to encourage women to take part in the tech community as attendees and lead them themselves.! The set-up varies between talks, fireside chats, workshops and socials.

As the aim celebrating the women in our industry, and not aiming to exclude, the event has a “Bring a Bloke” scheme, meaning each female attendee can bring one male friend if they want to attend.
