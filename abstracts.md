I like to practice what I preach, and I often preach about contributing to the tech community. As such, I am available to do talks or take part in panel discussions. 

There are a range of topics I'm happy to talk about. Get in contact if there is anything in particular you have in mind, I'm open to suggestions. Here are a few suggestions of areas:

+ Monitoring / Alerting / Logging
+ Community building
+ Attending hackathons
+ Starting and running a tech event
+ Imposter syndrome

Below are some of the abstracts I have made previously.

#### Don’t Be Afraid to Be A Great Engineer

In my first year of development there have been many highs and lows. Luckily for everyone else, I have learnt a few valuable lessons which I want to pass on. Some of these include how experience and intelligence aren’t the same thing, how backend development isn’t this scary land of mathematical world crushing problems and that even in your first few months you can have a big impact wherever you work. You can be afraid of many things, but never be afraid to be a great engineer.

#### Engaging With Your Local Tech Community

Every place has a tech community big or small. In this talk we will explore how you can seek out your local community and how to partake. This is everything from more passive roles, taking part in hackathons, conducting talks or even starting your own meetup. Tech communities are rewarding in many ways, don’t miss out.


#### A day in the life of the Elastic Novice
A company feels the strain of their current monitoring system. It’s not able to meet their growing needs. But how can they solve this problem when there are so many features to deliver? A developer becomes interested. They learn about the Elastic stack, useful for monitoring systems, and thus the Elastic Novice was born.

The Elastic Novice had only one week to implement a proof of concept. Find out about her trials, tribulations and victories in this epic tale of woman versus logging.

By joining us on this journey, attendees will learn about the challenges faced when first starting with the Elastic stack. This talk covers things to consider when first taking on a proof of concept and how the lessons can then be applied to a production environment.


#### Utilising the power of monitoring

With great power comes great responsibility and monitoring can be a very powerful tool. It can be used to aid debugging, performance monitoring, fraud detection, UX design, testing and much more. It’s not always used to its full potential however. Whether it has the power of Excalibur or a butter knife depends on how it is utilised. 

In this session, we will follow a company's journey in trying to harness the potential power of their monitoring strategy. We will talk about how they adopted a full business approach to monitoring. This will also cover the pros, cons and lessons learnt throughout this evolution.

If you are interested in monitoring and its power, or you just like pretty graphs, this is the talk for you.
