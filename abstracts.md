### Controlling Wildfires While Only Getting Singed

No software system is perfect. Deep down we all like that because it keeps things interesting, but what do you do when your system is further away from perfection than you’re comfortable with? It may be you are dealing with a legacy monolith or a system that has strange logic, no documentation and hardly any conventions you can recognise. Everything seems to be on fire and you need to stabilise the situation.

We’ll explore some techniques that are useful when working on systems that need a little love. At a high-level, we will go through approaching testing, monitoring, re-architecting and documenting these systems. We will also go through prioritisation when everything is urgent and the non-technical metrics that can help with buy-in for stabilising your system and team.

This talk is an intermediate level talk. The aim is for you to not only learn how to deal with these situations but want to tackle the challenges they present and be excited about the change you can lead.

### Introducing a Culture of Monitoring

“We need to monitor the things!” they cry, “We have a tool and it’s going to change our world!” they scream.

“What do you need to measure and why?…” you ask.

Silence follows.

In this talk, Jessica will explore the different aspects of monitoring from log analytics to business metrics. What steps do you take in getting cultural investment for monitoring? How do you determine what you need to measure? What patterns can you follow for this work? How do you keep the investment and enthusiasm for this work going?

This talk is for people of all walks of life in technology. The aim is to provide examples and guidance on what you measure, why you should be excited about it, how to sell this to your business and how to keep these measurements effective and useful.

### The Future is Cross-functional

It used to be that we all worked in our silos. Designers designed, Developers devved, Testers tested. The people in each of these sections of expertise only communicated when the process dictated. It was a world of waterfall.

This is no longer the world we live in. We are encouraged to work cross-functionally, but despite best intentions, it can be difficult to transfer to this way of thinking to develop this culture effectively. Can it be done? Yes! To demonstrate I will cover examples of where I have seen it work and why it did. We will also discuss some of the different flavours of cross-functional teams, and why you shouldn’t just care about DevOps or T-shaped development, but care about all forms of cross-functionality and their benefits.

This talk is aimed at all levels and all professions within technology. Come along, and I’ll show you not only why you should work together in this way, but also offer tips on how to achieve it.

### How to Talk Really Good

Our tech community is full of bright and interesting people, each with their unique experiences and points of view. Each and every person has something they can share that some of us would benefit from. You are one of these people. But how do you conquer that first step to submitting a talk, and what’s in it for you?

Let us be your guides through the challenging lands of talk submissions. From picking a topic to structuring the talk summary that will inspire and blow minds and submitting it. Finally, we’ll talk through why you should even think about speaking - it’s a scary thing to do, is it worth it?

By the end of this talk, you’ll not only be ready to inspire with your words but feel fully prepared to take on the world.

### A Practical Guide To Dashboarding

Dashboarding, also known as visualisation, is a difficult thing to do. First, there is a vast choice of tooling and setup. Then, figuring out what information should be displayed, where and why can be confusing.

Together we will journey through a practical tour of dashboarding. Focusing on metrics, we will go through some of the common patterns for services and API’s that can ensure your visualisations and dashboards are useful. Finally, I will demonstrate building a dashboard using these patterns using StatsD, Graphite, and Grafana.

This will be a whirlwind tour from start to finish on how to get started making useful development dashboards.

### Creating and Maintaining Impactful Dashboards

Creating useful dashboards is difficult. Figuring out what information should be displayed, where and why can be confusing. A useful first step in getting this right is to know who your audience is. Who will be using this dashboard? What for? What do they care about?

Together we will explore some of the many forms of dashboards, from those that are of most use to developers to those that display higher level information for business’. We’ll examine why they are important and what situations they are most useful in.

No matter what your role within a company, there will be a type of dashboard that will dazzle you with its insights. Come along and find out which dashboard you need.
