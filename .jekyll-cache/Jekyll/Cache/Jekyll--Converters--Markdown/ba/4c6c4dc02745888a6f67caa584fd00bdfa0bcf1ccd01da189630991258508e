<h3> A overview of my time in technology. </h3>
</center>
<hr />
<p><br /></p>

<p>I try to treat a lot of my career and personal development much like I would a technical iteration. I conduct retros, plan my work, try to put it in workable manageable chunks and tackle one thing at a time. To some degree this works, but as pressure builds sometimes the careful planning goes awry. I start trying to juggle tasks, the retro‚Äôs become more negative than constructive, as with a team that‚Äôs in a bad place starts to focus on all the negatives, I do the same to myself. This will go on a while until the rut is recognised and actions are made to change the status quo.</p>

<p>I think a lot of what we do in software engineering can be applied in day to day life. We are iterating on ourselves after all. Even for the little things (if you haven‚Äôt Kanban-ed your Christmas gift list yet - it will change your whole experience). There is one thing I haven‚Äôt adopted yet which is the sprint demo.</p>

<p>Most sprint demos are an act of celebration of the work completed. A huzzah and hurray. It‚Äôs a move from the negative gripes and the continual building to take a step back and show off the grand stuff you‚Äôve produced as a team. This is often done publicly to stakeholders, sometimes to the whole company if the company is small enough. For this experiment, you are my audience. Welcome to the sprint demo of my three years in Technology.</p>

<p>Now this post might seem like a <em>not so humble brag</em>, but honestly it‚Äôs not. I recognise when it‚Äôs written down, I‚Äôm doing pretty alright. It‚Äôs been a busy time. As with any retro for a piece of work that‚Äôs really dragging out, I have the bad habit of focusing on the negatives, what‚Äôs not gone to plan or what I haven‚Äôt done yet, never taking the time to acknowledge or celebrate what‚Äôs been accomplished. I‚Äôm hoping that by taking a step back and acknowledging how much progression I‚Äôve made and what‚Äôs been achieved in the last three years - I might start being a little nicer to myself for a while.</p>

<p>I went to a talk by Lars Klint at NDC Sydney where he talked about goal setting and making plans. I‚Äôm not the most confident person and I‚Äôm relatively introverted despite outward appearance. Over the years I have been working on being able to talk publically. This started with asking questions at events, then asking the first question, then trying to speak.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs not a thing I would have considered without encouragement from others. Thank you to the likes of Todd Gardner and Mat McLoughlin for critiquing abstracts and others for pep talks and advice. Also to Moreton, who is a continual support. It‚Äôs true what they say, you should surround yourself with more experienced, smarter people than yourself. It is a great way to learn and grow.</p>

<p>Off the back of these small accomplishments, I have had an amazing year. I have met people I admire, traveled the world (something I‚Äôve never been able to afford or have the time to do), I‚Äôve learnt new things and challenged myself. Speaking is still terrifying to me, but I am still learning and trying to make myself better.</p>

<p>Part of the reason I‚Äôve decided to do this publicly is to encourage others to stop, take a step back, and do the same. Whether your accomplishment is ‚Äúmade an omelette for the first time‚Äù or ‚Äúopened a chain of popular hotels‚Äù, they are your wins. They are personal. You are winning.</p>

<p>The book <em>Ends</em> talks about how people are really bad at acknowledging all kinds of ends. In a culture of iterating and improving, I guess I can understand why it is so hard.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm going to endeavour to do more personal sprint demos. Maybe not as public in the future, and definitely for shorter periods of time, but I am going to acknowledge the accomplishments.</p>

<p>Well, happy third tech birthday to me. Does this mean I‚Äôm a real grown-up developer yet?</p>
