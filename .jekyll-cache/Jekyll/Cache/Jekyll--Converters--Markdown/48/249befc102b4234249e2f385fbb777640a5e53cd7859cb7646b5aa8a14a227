<p>Google enables you to change your targeted adverts so you can indicate what you do and donâ€™t want to see. There are numerous reasons why I think this is and amazing feature.</p>

<p>First, there is gender targeted adverts. There are many sites that use this option. One example is Facebook. I have known many people who, fed up of seeing adverts related to dating sites and makeup because they have ticked the female box when signing up for a site, changed their settings to male so they could see tech and sports adverts instead.</p>

<p>There is a bigger reason why I think this is a great feature. There are many reasons why you might want to stop certain adverts displaying. Iâ€™ll use a personal example. As a 27 year old woman, for the last few years a lot of the adverts shown to me have been related to fertility, parenting and babies in general. Due to medical reasons, itâ€™s ill advised for me to ever have children. This can sometimes be very difficult. Having the option to remove these adverts has been a big life improvement.</p>

<p>There are many reasons why you might not want to see certain adverts. Hereâ€™s a guide on how to change your Google adâ€™s to help make life a bit better.</p>
