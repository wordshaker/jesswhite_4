<h3>Using a Raspberry Pi to make vocal alerts on a Sonos based off output from Datadog.</h3>

<h3 id="about">About</h3>

<p>This was a joint project between myself and my partner Moreton as our first attempt at using a RaspberryPi and test driving a Node.JS project. We both wanted to learn node and when I came up with the project idea as a piece of fun to help out the place I work at; it seemed like the perfect opportunity to learn Node.</p>

<h3 id="a-mvp-hack">A MVP Hack</h3>

<p>The aim of the first iteration was to enable a vocal alert to be sounded on a Sonos speaker based on events set up on <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com">DataDog</a>. This was done forking the code from <a href="https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api">sonos-http-api</a> to make a sonos server/api, <a href="http://www.voicerss.org/">Voice RSS</a> for the vocal mp3, writing our own code to write an API and the logic about what was to be said across the Sonos.</p>

<p>We test drove our code, pairing using a red, green, refactor pattern. Once it was shown to be working, <a href="https://ngrok.com">ngrok</a> was used to produce a secure url to configure a DataDog webhook to, using the webhook integration.</p>

<p>The code for this can be found <a href="href=&quot;https://github.com/sonos-alerts">here</a> with all current instructions on how to work it. The DataDog details are currently not included.</p>
